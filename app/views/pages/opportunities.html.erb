  It's never about what you have to do. When you join us, we ask you <span class="olgreen">what you feel you can do for us</span>. Lecturing's just one small part of the equation. You can help us spread the word, or make our content look good. What are you waiting for?
<%end%>
<p>We're looking for the crazy, the masochistic, and the passionate. The kind who do something over and over until it can't get any better. The kind who don't take "no" for an answer. The kind who make the impossible happen. Find out what it's like to work with us.</p>

        <h5 class="margin-reset">Cookie Monster</h3>
          <p>Cookie Monsters are our lecturers. They're involved in everything, from the curriculum design to the scripts, and right up to the lectures themselves. Why Cookies? What better way to bake a cookie than to put it under burning bright studio lights?</p>
        <h5 class="margin-reset">Slide Ninja</h5>
          <p>Ninjas normally do their work unseen and in the dark, but slide ninjas produce the slides that appear behind every lecturer. They're people with good artistic sense (for starters, they know the difference between Helvetica and Arial) and normally own a Mac. Nope, we're not discriminating, just discerning.</p>
        <h5 class="margin-reset">CamOp</h5>
          <p>CamOps play with cameras. They twiddle the buttons, turn the knobs, and are often spotted with large headphones around their ears giving people the 3-2-1 ACTION! They love arguing about f-stops, mixers and guide numbers, and they're responsible for making lecturers look and sound good in the studio.</p>
        <h5 class="margin-reset">Post-Proc</h5>
          <p>Post-Procs are the unsung heroes. When a lecture is finished, the Cookie Monsters, Ninjas and CamOps go for a drink. Post-Procs bravely step in to do the post-production. They're comfortable with Premiere Pro, After Effects and extremely long render times. Oh, and did we mention they're all closet OCD, because how good the final product looks is entirely up to them.</p>
